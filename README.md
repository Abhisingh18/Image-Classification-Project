# Image-Classification-Project
This repository contains a deep learning project that classifies images as either cats or dogs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The model is trained on a balanced dataset of labeled images and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between these two categories. The project includes data preprocessing scripts.
